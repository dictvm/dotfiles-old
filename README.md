# dotfiles

These dotfiles are work in progress.

## zsh
I'm assuming that zsh and ohmyzsh have been installed.

### Secret-handling
I've put my secrets in a locally kept `~/.secets`-file that isn't in git. The file is being sourced in `zshrc.local`.

## nvim
I'm assuming that neovim has been installed.

This currently isn't compatible with classic vim. However, two symlinks should do the trick.

## tmux 
I'm assuming that tmux has been installed.
